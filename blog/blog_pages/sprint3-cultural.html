            </div>
<div class="row">
Emotional intelligence (EI) is the ability to understand and manage your own emotions and also those of the people around you.
People who have a high degreee of emotional intelligence know how or what they are feeling, what their emotions mean and
also how these emotions can affect other people.

Someone who has a high IQ but lacks in emotional intelligence may do well at school, although will lack a lot of social skills.
This can hinder their success in real life due to the balance needed to succeed within a business or with groups of people.
A balance between the both of these is important to be well rounded, although many argue that developing EI is more 
important than having a higher IQ to be successful in life due to the ability to control your emotions and infulence other people
positively.
