<h2>Where did you get blocked with a problem?</h2>
The simple problems haven't been where I have been blocked on during the foundations content. Getting into string and array methods was where
I really needed to dig my toes in to go into depth to work out the problems and the solutions to them.<br><br>
Some of the problems I was able to go through content that I had researched on the internet about what needed to be done, others I needed to look at the solutions file to figure out what was going wrong. Once I had that information I would look into how the solutions came about to really try and understand the problem and then the soltuion. I definitely need more time and one-on-one time in this area and I will be looking forward to getting more into these in the future.

<h2>Where did you solve a problem in an elegant way.</h2>
One of the problems that I was able to go through well was the problem in the reflections journal. I could indentify that sum(5,2) was already a function
so I was solving a problem that had a function within a function. I talked and handled this in my sprint 3 technical blog (it's the very last example that I touch on) so I was able to go through this problem without too much hassle.

<h2>How confident you feel using problem solving techniques and process?</h2>             
<li><strong>Trying something: </strong></li><br>This was always how I will start my problem solving process. I will look over the code to see if I understand it. If I do, I will start working through the code with what I feel needs to be done to complete the code. If unsuccessful I start going through other problem solving techniques.<br><br>
<li><strong>Console.logging</strong></li><br> I found console logging a VERY effective way to understand what is happening and how to break things down, especially in the Kata exercises.<br>
If I could find a way to create a variable so that I could console log what I was going through it would make solving the problem far easier than not being able to do that.<br><br>                
<li><strong>Reading error messages</strong></li><br>
This is absolutely necessary to understand what is going wrong with you code and where. This can tell you what errors are happening in your code to make it incomplete and on which lines the console is having problem with.<br><br>                
<li><strong>Googling</strong></li><br>
Always the best option for problem solving if you don't have anyone to talk to and have an internet connection. There's a high chance that someone has run into the same or a similar problem to what you have online. Searching what you need to through google or looking at YouTube videos to learn is a very effective problem solving technique and one that I know many (even experienced) coders do regularly.<br><br>                
<li><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></li><br>
 When available it's always a great option to talk to someone directly about the problems you are having who have plenty of experience coding. Unlike Google where you really need to define what your problem is or may not know exactly what the problem is, talking to someone directly and showing the
 code can be (if not is) the most effective way of getting through a problem.<br><br>
<li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong></li><br>
This is the strongest way to learn and understand problems once they have been solving. If you can understand and work through the problem then you will be able to solve similar problems (or at least work through them more effectively than not) than if you just copy and pasted and/or finished the problem
straight after that.
